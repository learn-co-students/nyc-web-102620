# 2. Now, I need a way to hold a list of all of the pets in my app. Which datatype should I use? 
# 3. I want a list of only the names of each pet. How do I do that? What datatype should be returned?
# 4. I want to be to find all pets that are dogs. What iterator should I use? What datatype should be returned?
# 5. I want to be able to find a single dog with a specific name. How do I do that? What datatype should be returned?

# 1. show a list of all the names of all my pets
# 2. show me a list of just the pets that are... cats?
# 3. let me search for pet by name


def run
    puts "Application is running"
